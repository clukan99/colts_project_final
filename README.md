# colts_project_final

## Objective
The "project" folder contains the modeling files that I used to complete the colts analytics competition.

This is mostly to show how I completed my models with the python files. I neglected to put in the PCA data and
the one-hot-encoded data into this because of the size of their zip files. You may still create said files from
"data_curation.ipynb" and updated_datasets.zip.

The updated_datasets.zip contains the files that were given initially in the competition. 

Please feel free to "tour" my code and see what I have done.
